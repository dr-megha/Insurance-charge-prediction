# Insurance charge prediction
It is an exploratory project for predicting the medical insurance cost.
Classifcal machine learning models e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest and deeplearning approaches (ANN model) are tried to predict the medical insurance cost.

Data: Kaggle medical cost personal dataset is used to train the model: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

Results: It is a very small dataset, Random Forest predicts the insurance cost closest to the ground truth in comparison to neural network.

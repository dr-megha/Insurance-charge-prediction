# Insurance charge prediction
Here I explore a dataset dedicated to the cost of treatment of different patients. In this analysis, I have used Linear Regression, Random Forest and ANN model to predict the cost of treatment of the patients. 

Data: Kaggle medical cost personal dataset is used to train the model: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

Notes: Since it is a small dataset, Random Forest predicts the insurance cost closest to the ground truth in comparison to neural network.
